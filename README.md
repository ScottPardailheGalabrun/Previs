Steps to Use the Script :
1. Run the Script in After Effects, go to File > Scripts > Run Script File ... and select the saved .jsx file
2. You can fine-tune by manually adjusting the effects inside the adjustment layer
3. You can apply the same adjustment layer to multiple clips within your composition or copy the settings to other adjustment layers

NB. Although this script tries to update name properties per the After Effects version you have installed on your pc, manual changes may be needed to specific name properties, depending on your version :)
